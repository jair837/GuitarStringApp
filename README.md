This project is a Java-based guitar string tuner with a graphical interface. 
It captures audio from the microphone, analyzes the signal in real time, and detects which standard guitar string is being played.
The application is designed for stability, reducing false positives and preventing the display from jumping between notes.
The Features were Real-time audio input and processing, Detection of standard guitar strings, Visual interface with a circular display and feedback indicators.
The program used signal analysis techniques to estimate pitch, while including methods to filter noise and improve stability.
  THe basic controls for starting, stopping, and resetting detection were included.
